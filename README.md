# ChatBulario

This project aims to develop a Generative AI system capable of engaging in comprehensive knowledge retrieval and dialogue, utilizing medical leaflets collected from the ANVISA website as its primary informational source.

## Overview

The project encompasses the full spectrum of GenAI text-based development, including data ingestion, pre-processing, feature engineering, embedding creation, vector database construction, knowledge graph formation, semantic search implementation, chatbot engine design, user interface development, and integration with communication platforms such as Discord and other chat-based applications.

By implementing these components, we strive to establish a robust and informative AI entity capable of offering assistance and engaging in meaningful discourse within the domain of human medicine.

This project isn't focused on launching a consumer-facing product or app. Instead, it aims to provide resources for the community by contributing open-source projects, ideas, code, datasets, and models.

I hope this project could benefit a variety of developers, including researchers, students working on GenAI projects, and individuals interested in learning more about the technology.
