This project aims to develop a Generative AI system capable of engaging in comprehensive knowledge retrieval and dialogue, utilizing medical leaflets collected from the ANVISA website as its primary informational source.

The project encompasses the full spectrum of GenAI text-based development, including data ingestion, pre-processing, feature engineering, embedding creation, vector database construction, knowledge graph formation, semantic search implementation, chatbot engine design, user interface development, and integration with communication platforms such as Discord and other chat-based applications.

By implementing these components, we strive to establish a robust and informative AI entity capable of offering assistance and engaging in meaningful discourse within the domain of human medicine.
